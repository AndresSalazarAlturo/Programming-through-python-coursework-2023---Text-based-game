        In the eerie silence of a long-forgotten research complex, shadows danced menacingly 
        across abandoned hallways. A lone survivor of an ill-fated expedition, found 
        himself trapped within its labyrinthine corridors. As he navigated through the dimly 
        lit chambers, flickering lights revealed cryptic symbols etched on the walls, hinting 
        at an otherworldly experiment gone awry. 
        
        The air was thick with an unsettling tension,
        and distant echoes of unseen horrors amplified the sense of isolation. Your only 
        companions are the haunting memories of your colleagues and the lingering uncertainty 
        of the complex's malevolent secrets. Unraveling the mystery became not just a quest for 
        survival, but a descent into the unknown depths of a forsaken realm.

        You do not want to perish here, alone and maybe part of an perverse experiment so you move
        and look your way out of the small room.

        How to play:
        Order the figures in the correct order, the answer is random so try as many combinations as you
        can. The figures are: triangle, square, circle. Please type the exact name of each figure, however

        Try to solve all the operations in less than 20 seconds and open the dining_room door, good luck.

        How to play:
        Type 'start' to play the game.
        Type 'back' to quit the game.

        Tip: If you fail the operations and want to try again. Use the command 'use' + 'operation_game'.

        Answer correctly all the operations within the time limit and get the item. If fail, try again
        you have unlimited opportunities. Hope you scape ASAP!
